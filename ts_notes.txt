steps to get stuff working on the RISC-V official test suite:

0. make sure you can run binaries generated by binutils.
1. maybe manually test some instructions. helpful to figure out what works and what doesn't.
 - the test suite basically requires that you have a semi-functional system to test with.
2. install riscv-gnu-toolchain
	- as of 6/2020, default toolchain doesn't compile properly. The SiFive toolchain works fine, however.
3. install riscv-tests
4. once built, "isa" dir will contain a series of assembly tests.
4. ??
5. profit

things required outside the regular RV32I instruction set (volume 1):
 - Zicsr, so we can read and write from control registers.
 	- 4096 registers defined
	- registers needed: mcause

weird instructions:
 - unimp - just a SYSTEM opcode with a non-zero funct3
